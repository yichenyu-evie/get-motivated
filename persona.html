        <h3>Study</h3>
        <p>The initial incentive for developing Keep-Motivated app is to have a higher efficiency for studying. After quarantine, all the classes switch to online and the study environments suddenly change to our homes. However, we often have some distrations when we studying at home. Therefore, studying with other people in our app will ensure the efficency.</p>

        <h3>Workout</h3>
        <p>After quarantine, almost all the gym are closed to keep everyone's safety. In this way, finding some partners on our platform and exercise will be a good idea. Consisting workout is not an easy thing and we sometimes lose passion when we do it alone. Thus, our app cannot only be an extra motivation but also adding fun to your workout. </p>

        <h3>Instruments</h3>
        <p>As we all know, practicing an instrument needs patience and time. Though rractice makes perfect, practice is usually boring. No worries if you are on our app! We will sort you and other people who have the same interest in a group so that you can communicate and share experience. Besides developing habits on instruments, other habits develop well on our app too!</p>

        <h3>Quitting an habit</h3>
        <p>Developing an habit is not easy. In contrast, some habits are hard to quit. For example, it always takes a long time for people to quit smoking. The quitting process is always suffering and sometimes we just give up. However, if there's other people quitting the same habit as you, encouragement to each other will become a great motivation to insist!</p>
